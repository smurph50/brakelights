This project started when I was stuck in frequently when driving to DC from Baltimore to visit my girlfriend. Going south on state highway 295 was two lanes with few exits. I had seen that many drivers would go as fast as they could then slam on the breaks. I had heard that driving at a constant rate with a larger gap to the car ahead could prevent traffic jams by not using your brake lights. I wondered if this was also true for relieving traffic, but I could not find data addressing this question.

I selected Negal and Schreckenberg model of traffic on a highway [1]. It is a simple one and can be easily modeled in python.
